#Snow Leopard Button

This is a tiny spin-off of the [Hidden Search Widget](https://github.com/SarahJD/hidden-search-widget):

Click on the button and a beautiful animal will show up.

The button fires off a JavaScript event that adds a specific class that translates the image on the x-axis.

I used CSS transitions along with a bit of JavaScript to add the event and toggle the class.
